 A programming language serves as a structured set of symbols and rules designed for crafting computer programs. While many of these languages are text-based, some also integrate graphical elements. Their primary purpose is to articulate instructions that enable computers to execute specific tasks, ranging from creating basic web pages to developing intricate video games. Currently, a diverse array of programming languages exists, each boasting unique attributes that facilitate the translation of human concepts into executable computer commands.
